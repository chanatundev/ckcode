# Appearance and themes

On web and desktop, open **Settings → Appearance** to choose a theme and follow the system
appearance or stay in light or dark mode. To use different themes for light and dark mode, select
the corresponding preview within each theme. Appearance preferences are saved separately on each
device or browser.

On web and desktop, use **Change theme** in the command palette to select a theme without leaving chat.
Press **Cmd+Option+A** on macOS or **Ctrl+Alt+A** on Windows/Linux to open the theme picker directly.
Use **Change appearance** in the command palette to choose System, Light, or Dark independently of
the theme. **Cmd+Option+Shift+A** on macOS or **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+A** on Windows/Linux cycles through
those modes. Customize these shortcuts under **Settings → Keybindings**.

On mobile, open **Settings → Appearance**. Mobile has its own themes and text,
code, and terminal preferences. It does not follow environment themes or defaults.

On Android 12 or newer, choose the **Material You** theme in Appearance to use colors from
your wallpaper. Selecting another theme replaces those colors. Like other themes, Material You
can be selected separately for light and dark appearances.
Android uses **Material You Layout** by default unless you have turned it off in Appearance.
It changes shapes, spacing, and controls independently
of the selected theme.

## Motion

The main sidebar, right panel, and terminal drawer open and close immediately by default. Move the
**Panel animations** slider above 0 ms to add motion, up to 400 ms, unless reduced motion is enabled
in your operating system. Moving between threads always snaps to the selected thread's panel state
without replaying its transitions.

## Sidekick

On desktop, the sidekick is a small character that floats above your other windows and shows what
your agents are doing across every thread and connected environment. Send `/sidekick`, choose
**Toggle sidekick** in the command palette or **View → Toggle Sidekick**, or turn on
**Settings → General → Sidekick**. It is off by default and saved separately on each device.

When several threads differ, it shows the most urgent state: approval needed, then questions,
failures, ready plans, work in progress, and finished threads you have not opened. A badge counts
the threads that need you. Click the sidekick to open the thread that has waited longest; click
again to move to the next. Failures and completions clear once you open the thread. After 30 idle
minutes it falls asleep, and it only shows as offline when no environment is connected.

Hover over the sidekick to list the threads that need you, are working, or finished since you last
opened them, each with its status. Click one to open that thread.

Drag it anywhere. Right-click it to change its size, reset its position, or hide it.

## Custom themes

On web and desktop, choose **Create theme** to adjust a palette, or import a T3 Code or VS Code
theme. The theme editor's color picker lets you select an area of the app to find the color to
change. Export your theme as JSON to share it.

## Environment themes

Environment themes and defaults come from the server serving your web app or the desktop app's
main local environment. app.t3.codes and additional connections do not use them.

Select a published theme in **Settings → Appearance** to follow its palette as the server updates
it. **Duplicate** makes an independent copy you can edit. A saved custom theme with the same ID
takes precedence. If the server stops publishing the selected theme, T3 Code falls back to its
standard theme.

Run this on the server to set a default and switch connected clients to it:

```bash
t3 theme set nightfall
```

Clients that are offline apply it when they reconnect. Each client applies the setting once;
choosing another theme afterward sticks until the next `t3 theme set`. Run the command again to
reapply it, even if the name is unchanged.

`t3 theme clear` removes the default without changing anyone's current theme. `t3 theme show` lists
the default and published themes.

### Publish a theme

Save a theme exported from T3 Code into `~/.t3/userdata/themes/` on the server, or the `themes`
directory under your custom state directory. The filename supplies the theme ID: `nightfall.json`
can be selected with `t3 theme set nightfall`. Keep the filename stable when updating its colors.
Do not use `system`, `light`, `dark`, or a built-in theme's ID.

For an integration that generates a palette, this shorter format also works:

```json
{
  "name": "Nightfall",
  "appearance": "dark",
  "canvas": "#1a1b26",
  "accent": "#7aa2f7",
  "colors": {
    "terminalSelection": "#292e42",
    "error": "#f7768e"
  }
}
```

Set `appearance` to `light` or `dark` and supply hex colors for `canvas` and `accent`. T3 Code
generates the rest. The optional `colors` overrides use the names in the theme editor's advanced
view.

Write updates to a temporary file and rename it into place so clients never read a partial theme.
Invalid files are not published.
